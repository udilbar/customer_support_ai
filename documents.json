Without completing the coaching call there will be no access to projects. Other types of activities will appear like a mock interview, meetups, etc. Projects are due Friday and will have to be uploaded on Reddit for peer feedback. Those who submit projects will have access to the hackathon. Teammates will be made from Week 3 and each week there will be a teammate evaluation. Every other weekend will be a virtual hackathon and the other weekends will be an IRL meetup"
